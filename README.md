# 📊 Northwind SQL Projects

## Overview

This repository contains SQL projects that demonstrate various querying techniques using the Northwind database. The projects showcase skills in data retrieval, filtering, sorting, joining tables, grouping data, and using aggregate functions.

## 🧠 Skills Learned

### 📋 Data Retrieval
- **SELECT Queries**: Extracting specific columns and rows from tables
- **Filtering with WHERE**: Applying conditions to filter data
- **Sorting with ORDER BY**: Sorting data in ascending or descending order

### 🔗 Joining Tables
- **INNER JOIN**: Combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column

- **LEFT JOIN**: Including all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table
- 
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Including all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table

### 📊 Grouping and Aggregation
- **GROUP BY**: Grouping rows that have the same values in specified columns
- **Aggregate Functions**: Using functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT` to perform calculations on grouped data

### 🔍 Advanced Querying
- **Subqueries**: Writing queries within queries to perform complex operations
- **Pattern Matching with LIKE**: Searching for patterns in data using wildcard characters

## 📁 SQL Concepts Covered

- Basic SELECT queries
- Filtering data with WHERE clause
